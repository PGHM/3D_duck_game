# 3D Duck Game

As part of a graphics basics course I had to do a project assigment. I chose
to do a 3D game. The aim of the game is pretty simple, you have to collect
ducks and avoid bombs that a skull shoots at you.

I have never done anything like this before this assignment or after this
assignment and the end result still makes me laugh. It was so much fun to make
this and use trigonometry to create something "real". The worst part was
finding free to use object models that Processing would support. And the fact
I had to use Java to code this.

There must have been some kind of restriction in Processing that you can use
only a single file, I cannot fathom why else I would have used just a single
file to house all the code, but it is what it is.

## Modifications after the original project

During summer of 2021 someone asked me how the game looks and I used way too
much time to make the code run again and even find new models to replace ones
that I did not have anymore. They are different than the original ones and for
some models I did not even find replacements. But now the code can be run
again and there is updated binary.

## Documentation

[The original documentation](/documentation.txt) that was returned as part of
the project work describes in almost too detailed way how the code works and
how the project was originally done. Not giving myself any points on the
quality of that one...

## Running the code

You need [Processing
1.5.1](https://www.npackd.org/p/org.processing.Processing/1.5.1) to run the
code.

All the other required dependencies should be in the repository.

## Compiled binary

There is a [compiled binary](\game_executable_binary_windows_x64.zip) that you
can run in Windows 7/10/11 systems with 64-bit architecture. It uses the
updated models and no longer has the tree object that was lost in time.
